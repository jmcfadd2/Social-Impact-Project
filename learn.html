          <h2>Gentrification in Philadelphia</h2>
          <p>
            Gentrification is caused when an area&apos;s real estate value is very
            low but is located near or has new transport lines to middle class
            amenities.
          </p>

          <p>
            This provides an opportunity for developers to make high profits on
            rebuilding or renovating low-income houses, turning them into middle
            class housing and eventually pricing out the established low-income
            residents.
          </p>

          <p>
            Examples of this in Philadelphia can be seen in the Graduate
            Hospital (GH) area of Philadelphia and the Northern Liberties (NL)
            area of Philadelphia.
          </p>
          <p>
            In Northern Liberties, for example, artists were attracted to the
            area because of the large abandoned warehouses for their studios. As
            more influencers in arts and culture the draw to live in NL grew
            amongst the middle class and young professionals and soon the
            developers began building new housing in the area. Leading to a
            dramatic increase in the rent cost from the years 2001-2014. This
            rent spike forced many people out, 93% of them African-American.

          <h2>Is it revitalization?</h2>
          <p>
            Some say detractors say that what is known as gentrification is
            actually revitalization and is a positive impact on communities.
            They cite the rise in property values and boost in public school
            funding as evidence. But if long-term residents are not around to
            reap these benefits the positive impact goes towards outsiders.

          <h2>Where does it occur?</h2>
          
            <p>
              Gentrification is said to begin in such neighborhoods when the
              difference between the current real estate prices, which are low,
              and the potential prices, which are higher, becomes large enough to
              attract a wave of new investment and higher-income residents.
            </p>
            
            <p>
              In Graduate Hospital, historically a working-class African American,
              has close access to Broad and South Streets, respectively. This
              access and the fact that in 2000 42% of single-family homes were
              investor owned led to the dramatic rise in the cost of living from
              2000-2014.
            </p> 
            <p>
              Developers jumped on the profit opportunity building new
              and renovated homes and sending surrounding home prices soaring.
              Home values tripled during this time period and brought in an influx
              of wealthier individuals that were 90% percent white.
            </p> 
            <p>
              This led to a
              decrease in the Afican American population of GH from 90% African
              American to 38% African American.
